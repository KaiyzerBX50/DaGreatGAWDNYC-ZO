# DaGreatGAWDNYC-ZO

This repository is the home for your Zo Skills.

## Folder layout

- Each top-level folder is one Skill.
- Inside each Skill folder:
  - `SKILL.md` describes the Skill and how Zo should use it
  - `scripts/` contains optional code for the Skill

## Adding a new Skill

1. Create a new folder at the repo root (use a short, lowercase name with hyphens)
2. Add a `SKILL.md`
3. Add `scripts/` if the Skill needs code

## Secrets

Do not commit API keys or passwords.
Store secrets in Zo at **Settings → Advanced → Secrets**.
