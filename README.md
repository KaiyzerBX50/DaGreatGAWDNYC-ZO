# DaGreatGAWDNYC-ZO

This repository is the home for your Zo Skills.

## What’s inside

- `Skills/` — each subfolder is a Skill (a self-contained automation/tool Zo can run)

## How to add a new Skill

1. Create a new folder under `Skills/` (use a short, lowercase name with hyphens)
2. Add a `SKILL.md` inside that folder
3. Add any scripts under `scripts/` (optional)

## Notes

- Do not commit secrets (API keys, passwords). Store secrets in Zo at **Settings → Advanced → Secrets**.
