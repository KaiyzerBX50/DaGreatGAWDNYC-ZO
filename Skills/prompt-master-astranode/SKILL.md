# Prompt Master AstraNode

Transform any request into a perfectly structured, paste-ready AI prompt.

## For End Users

**Just say:** "Create a prompt for [your request]" or "Optimize this prompt: [paste your prompt]"

Zo will guide you through the prompt creation process or direct you to the web app.

## Web App

🔗 **https://astranode-v2-dagawdnyc.zocomputer.io/**

Enter your request → Get a paste-ready prompt → Better results on first try.

## When to Use

- Creating prompts for Claude, ChatGPT, or other AI tools
- Optimizing existing prompts for better outputs
- Need structured prompts with clear sections

## Prompt Structure

Every generated prompt includes:

```
ROLE
[Who the AI should act as - expertise, perspective, background]

CONTEXT
[Background details, situation, and constraints that frame the task]

TASK
1. [First deliverable]
2. [Second deliverable]
...

CONSTRAINTS
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]

OUTPUT FORMAT
[Exact structure expected - headings, bullets, length, tone]

QUALITY CHECK
- [Success criterion 1]
- [Success criterion 2]

FOLLOW-UP
[None, or up to 2 clarifying questions if needed]
```

## Key Principles

1. **Paste-ready on first use** — prompts should work immediately
2. **Structured sections** — ROLE, CONTEXT, TASK, CONSTRAINTS, OUTPUT FORMAT, QUALITY CHECK
3. **Constraints are critical** — without them, AI gives fantasy answers
4. **No invention** — never make up facts, names, stats, or citations
5. **Safety first** — refuse disallowed parts, offer safe alternatives
