• SMS: same format
• Drag & drop Markdown files

🔒 Your data, your rules
No cloud. No tracking. No subscriptions.
Just you and your Zo.

📦 Get started:
Copy the `stickie-zo` skill to your Zo Computer and you're done.

**"How do I install it?"**
```
Copy the stickie-zo folder from Skills into your Zo Computer.
Then either:
1. Open the web app
2. Use chat/SMS "postit: ..." 
3. Drag files into Space/postits/cards

That's it.
```

**"Will this work on my phone?"**
```
Yes. Open https://stickiezo-dagawdnyc.zocomputer.io on your phone.
Password protected. Dark mode. Optimized for quick capture.
```

**"What if I want to share a note?"**
```
They're just Markdown files in Space/postits/cards/.
Share the file, or copy the text. You own them completely.
```

**"Is there a desktop app?"**
```
Not needed. The web app works everywhere.
All your notes are in your file system anyway.
```
