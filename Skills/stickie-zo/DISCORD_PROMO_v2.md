## Thread starter (if people ask questions)

**Q: Where does my data go?**
A: `Space/postits/cards/` on your Zo. That's it. You own it.

**Q: Can I edit the note files directly?**
A: Yes. They're just Markdown. Edit them in any text editor.

**Q: What if I restart my Zo?**
A: Everything's still there. It all lives in your files.

**Q: Does it sync to the cloud?**
A: Nope. That's the whole point.
