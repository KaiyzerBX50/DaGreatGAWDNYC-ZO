# zo.space backup (source-of-truth export)

This folder stores copies of key routes from **dagawdnyc.zo.space** so the code lives in GitHub.

Notes
- zo.space routes do not live in the workspace by default. They are stored in Zo Space.
- These files are an export for version control, review, and portability.

Exported routes
- `/signal-pulse` (page) → `routes/signal-pulse.page.tsx`
- `/api/signal-pulse` (api) → `routes/api.signal-pulse.ts`
- `/api/signal-pulse-health` (api) → `routes/api.signal-pulse-health.ts`
